The USGS Geomagnetism Program currently uses MiniSEED to store geomagnetic
data and has been internally discussing updates to the Station, Network,
Channel, and Location (SNCL) codes used to uniquely identify this data.
At the 2017 Intermagnet Annual Meeting, it was discovered NRCAN is also
considering MiniSEED storage of data.  In both cases the intent is to leverage
existing solutions for timeseries data from the seismology community.

This project is an attempt to establish a common best practice for SNCL
labeling of geomagnetic data using existing SEED SNCL standards; making
it easier to exchange data between these and other international groups.

We welcome input from INTERMAGNET members, and other organizations and
individuals.


MiniSEED conventions are described in a SEED Manual Appendix:
